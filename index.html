                    <p class="description">This project was for a client of mine. He wanted me to help him create this game for his university entrance exam. This game uses the Python module Pygame as its game engine. The game is turn-based, where the unit, whether enemy or yours, fills up its attack bar first can have a turn. It was a job request that I have taken on the freelancing website called Upwork.</p>

                    <h1>Tower Defense</h1>
                    <p class="description">A game I have created using Pygame. It is a simple tower defense with three towers to use and three kinds of enemies to defeat. You can customize the map however you want, change the path enemies take, change the number of enemies per round, and change the texture the map uses.  It uses an excel file for designating the map's enemy pathway and rounds nature.</p>
